# ButterUp

**ButterUp** is ~~butter~~ better than XML ðŸ˜‰

ButterUp is a *lightweight*, formally defined, super-simple markup language and preprocessor inspired by LaTeX, for both documents and data.  It's ideal as a frontend preprocessor for DocBook and DITA, or any XML/XSLT/XSL-FO pipeline, but can also just make writing XML data files or XHTML documents more pleasant.

## Why ButterUp?

- **LaTeX-like syntax**: Use familiar backslash commands and curly braces for structure, with support for macros, variables, and includes.
- **Flexible output**: Convert your ButterUp files into **DocBook XML**, **PDF**, **HTML**, or other formats.
- **Lightweight and readable**: Write structured documents without all the overhead of XML markup.
- A deliberately limited set of powerful preprocessor features: variables, macros, and includes.

## Example: How It Works

Here's a quick taste of ButterUp in action:

### Input: ButterUp `.btr` File

```latex
\section{Welcome to ButterUp}
Writing structured documents is easy with ButterUp! Let's see a few features:

\subsection{Variables}
Define a variable using \\def:

\def{\name}{Alice}
My name is \${name}.

\subsection{Macros}
Define and expand macros just like in LaTeX:

\newcommand{\greet}[1]{Hello, \#1!}
\greet{world}

\subsection{Includes}
Include content from other files:

\#include{chapter1.btr}
```

### Output: PDF/HTML (Rendered)

```latex

Once you've written your `.btr` file, you can convert it to different formats like **DocBook XML**, **PDF**, or **HTML**.

#### Convert to DocBook XML

```bash
btr document.btr > document.xml
```

#### Convert to PDF

```bash
fopub document.xml
```

#### Convert to HTML

## Example `.btr` File

Here's a more advanced example of what you can do with ButterUp:

```latex
\section{Welcome to ButterUp}
Let me show you a few cool features.

\subsection{Variables}
You can define variables with \def:

\def{\userName}{John}
Hi, my name is \${userName}.

\subsection{Macros}
Macros allow for reusable components:

\newcommand{\intro}[1]{Welcome, \#1!}
\intro{friend}
```

After running the `btr` command, you can convert this into the output format of your choice!

```bash
btr yourfile.btr
```
